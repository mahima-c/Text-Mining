       " 'She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate  indulgent father  and had  in consequence of her sister s marriage  been mistress of his house from a very early period ',\n",
       " 'Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses  and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess  who had fallen little short of a mother in affection ',\n",
       " 'Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr  Woodhouse s family  less as a governess than a friend  very fond of both daughters  but particularly of Emma ',\n",
       " 'Between  them  it was more the intimacy of sisters ',\n",
       " 'Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess  the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint  and the shadow of authority being now long passed away  they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached  and Emma doing just what she liked  highly esteeming Miss Taylor s judgment  but directed chiefly by her own ',\n",
       " 'The real evils  indeed  of Emma s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way  and a disposition to think a little too well of herself  these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments ',\n",
       " 'The danger  however  was at present so unperceived  that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her ',\n",
       " 'Sorrow came  a gentle sorrow  but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness   Miss Taylor married ',\n",
       " 'It was Miss Taylor s loss which first brought grief ',\n",
       " 'It was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance ',\n",
       " 'The wedding over  and the bride people gone  her father and herself were left to dine together  with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening ',\n",
       " 'Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner  as usual  and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost ',\n",
       " 'The event had every promise of happiness for her friend ',\n",
       " 'Mr  Weston was a man of unexceptionable character  easy fortune  suitable age  and pleasant manners  and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self denying  generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match  but it was a black morning s work for her ',\n",
       " 'The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day ',\n",
       " 'She recalled her past kindness  the kindness  the affection of sixteen years  how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old  how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health  and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood ',\n",
       " 'A large debt of gratitude was owing here  but the intercourse of the last seven years  the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella s marriage  on their being left to each other  was yet a dearer  tenderer recollection ',\n",
       " 'She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed  intelligent  well informed  useful  gentle  knowing all the ways of the family  interested in all its concerns  and peculiarly interested in herself  in every pleasure  every scheme of hers  one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose  and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault ',\n",
       " 'How was she to bear the change   It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them  but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs  Weston  only half a mile from them  and a Miss Taylor in the house  and with all her advantages  natural and domestic  she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude ',\n",
       " 'She dearly loved her father  but he was no companion for her ',\n",
       " 'He could not meet her in conversation  rational or playful ',\n",
       " 'The evil of the actual disparity in their ages  and Mr  Woodhouse had not married early  was much increased by his constitution and habits  for having been a valetudinarian all his life  without activity of mind or body  he was a much older man in ways than in years  and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper  his talents could not have recommended him at any time ',\n",
       " 'Her sister  though comparatively but little removed by matrimony  being settled in London  only sixteen miles off  was much beyond her daily reach  and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield  before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband  and their little children  to fill the house  and give her pleasant society again ',\n",
       " 'Highbury  the large and populous village  almost amounting to a town  to which Hartfield  in spite of its separate lawn  and shrubberies  and name  did really belong  afforded her no equals ',\n",
       " 'The Woodhouses were first in consequence there ',\n",
       " 'All looked up to them ',\n",
       " 'She had many acquaintance in the place  for her father was universally civil  but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day ',\n",
       " 'It was a melancholy change  and Emma could not but sigh over it  and wish for impossible things  till her father awoke  and made it necessary to be cheerful ',\n",
       " 'His spirits required support ',\n",
       " 'He was a nervous man  easily depressed  fond of every body that he was used to  and hating to part with them  hating change of every kind ',\n",
       " 'Matrimony  as the origin of change  was always disagreeable  and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter s marrying  nor could ever speak of her but with compassion  though it had been entirely a match of affection  when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too  and from his habits of gentle selfishness  and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself  he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them  and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield ',\n",
       " 'Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could  to keep him from such thoughts  but when tea came  it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner    Poor Miss Taylor   I wish she were here again ',\n",
       " 'What a pity it is that Mr  Weston ever thought of her  ',\n",
       " ' I cannot agree with you  papa  you know I cannot ',\n",
       " 'Mr  Weston is such a good humoured  pleasant  excellent man  that he thoroughly deserves a good wife   and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever  and bear all my odd humours  when she might have a house of her own  ',\n",
       " ' A house of her own   But where is the advantage of a house of her own ',\n",
       " 'This is three times as large   And you have never any odd humours  my dear  ',\n",
       " ' How often we shall be going to see them  and they coming to see us   We shall be always meeting ',\n",
       " ' We  must begin  we must go and pay wedding visit very soon  ',\n",
       " ' My dear  how am I to get so far ',\n",
       " 'Randalls is such a distance ',\n",
       " 'I could not walk half so far  ',\n",
       " ' No  papa  nobody thought of your walking ',\n",
       " 'We must go in the carriage  to be sure  ',\n",
       " ' The carriage ',\n",
       " 'But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way   and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit  ',\n",
       " ' They are to be put into Mr  Weston s stable  papa ',\n",
       " 'You know we have settled all that already ',\n",
       " 'We talked it all over with Mr  Weston last night ',\n",
       " 'And as for James  you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls  because of his daughter s being housemaid there ',\n",
       " 'I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else ',\n",
       " 'That was your doing  papa ',\n",
       " 'You got Hannah that good place ',\n",
       " 'Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her  James is so obliged to you  ',\n",
       " ' I am very glad I did think of her ',\n",
       " 'It was very lucky  for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account  and I am sure she will make a very good servant  she is a civil  pretty spoken girl  I have a great opinion of her ',\n",
       " 'Whenever I see her  she always curtseys and asks me how I do  in a very pretty manner  and when you have had her here to do needlework  I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it ',\n",
       " 'I am sure she will be an excellent servant  and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see ',\n",
       " 'Whenever James goes over to see his daughter  you know  she will be hearing of us ',\n",
       " 'He will be able to tell her how we all are  ',\n",
       " 'Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas  and hoped  by the help of backgammon  to get her father tolerably through the evening  and be attacked by no regrets but her own ',\n",
       " 'The backgammon table was placed  but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary ',\n",
       " 'Mr  Knightley  a sensible man about seven or eight and thirty  was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family  but particularly connected with it  as the elder brother of Isabella s husband ',\n",
       " 'He lived about a mile from Highbury  was a frequent visitor  and always welcome  and at this time more welcome than usual  as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London ',\n",
       " 'He had returned to a late dinner  after some days  absence  and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square ',\n",
       " 'It was a happy circumstance  and animated Mr  Woodhouse for some time ',\n",
       " 'Mr  Knightley had a cheerful manner  which always did him good  and his many inquiries after  poor Isabella  and her children were answered most satisfactorily ',\n",
       " 'When this was over  Mr  Woodhouse gratefully observed   It is very kind of you  Mr  Knightley  to come out at this late hour to call upon us ',\n",
       " 'I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk  ',\n",
       " ' Not at all  sir ',\n",
       " 'It is a beautiful moonlight night  and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire  ',\n",
       " ' But you must have found it very damp and dirty ',\n",
       " 'I wish you may not catch cold  ',\n",
       " ' Dirty  sir ',\n",
       " 'Look at my shoes ',\n",
       " 'Not a speck on them  ',\n",
       " ' Well ',\n",
       " 'that is quite surprising  for we have had a vast deal of rain here ',\n",
       " 'It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast ',\n",
       " 'I wanted them to put off the wedding  ',\n",
       " ' By the bye  I have not wished you joy ',\n",
       " 'Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling  I have been in no hurry with my congratulations  but I hope it all went off tolerably well ',\n",
       " 'How did you all behave ',\n",
       " 'Who cried most  ',\n",
       " ' Ah ',\n",
       " 'poor Miss Taylor ',\n",
       " ' Tis a sad business  ',\n",
       " ' Poor Mr  and Miss Woodhouse  if you please  but I cannot possibly say  poor Miss Taylor  ',\n",
       " 'I have a great regard for you and Emma  but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence   At any rate  it must be better to have only one to please than two  ',\n",
       " ' Especially when  one  of those two is such a fanciful  troublesome creature  ',\n",
       " 'said Emma playfully ',\n",
       " ' That is what you have in your head  I know  and what you would certainly say if my father were not by  ',\n",
       " ' I believe it is very true  my dear  indeed   said Mr  Woodhouse  with a sigh ',\n",
